# LetsMakanTogether

## Introduction

At Let'sMakanTogether, we believe that sharing a meal with friends is one of life's simple joys and it can be challenging to do so in today's fast-paced world. That's why we've created this platform that makes it easier than ever to connect with like-minded food enthusiasts and turn dining into a social experience.

## Directory Structure

- `vue`: This directory contains the Vue.js frontend of the application.
- `server`: This directory contains the Node.js backend of the application.
- `nginx`: This directory contains the configuration for the Nginx server that hosts the frontend.
- `database`: This directory contains the MySQL database scripts.
- `docker`: This directory contains the Docker configuration for the Vue + Nginx, Node, and MySQL services.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For development and testing environments, you will need the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Our project uses it for the backend server.
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/): MySQL is a relational database management system. Our project uses it for data storage.
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/download.html): Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. Our project uses it for hosting the frontend.

For production environments, you will need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Docker is a platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Our project uses it for containerizing the Vue + Nginx, Node, and MySQL services.

Instructions on how to install these software will be provided in the "Installing" section.
